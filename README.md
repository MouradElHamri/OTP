# Optimal Transport Propagation (OTP)
A Label Propagation algorithm based on Optimal Transport 

## Installation and Dependencies

**Optimal Transport Propagation** is based on `NumPy`, `Pandas` and `POT`. 
So, make sure these packages are installed. For example, you can install them with `pip`:

```
pip3 install numpy pandas POT
```

It is recommend to use `Python 3.8` from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution. All the codes for the article are tested on macOS Big Sur Version 11.2.3


## Usage
To reproduce the results, a `jupyter notebook` is provided in `./Optimal_Transport_Propagation.ipynb`.
The  experiment  was  designed  to  evaluate  OTP on Iris and Digits datasets. To reproduce all the results in the paper, the other datasets are available on https://archive.ics.uci.edu.
